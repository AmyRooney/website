        <p id="info">Yoshitomo Nara is a Japanese artist living and working in  Nasushiobara, Tochigi Prefecture. His work has been exhibited worldwide and he has had nearly 40 solo exhibitions since 1984. His work has been in places like the MoMA and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. <br>
        Nara's artwork is quite simple with depections of children or animals drawn with an cartoonish artstyle with very little or no background. Even though the characters look somewhat innocent many of them can be seen holding weapons but an angry or tired expression. <br>
    Nara's artwork explores themes of isolation,rebellion, and spirtuality. Nara uses many different mediums in his artwork such as printmaking, painting, sculpture, ceramics, and installations. </p>
